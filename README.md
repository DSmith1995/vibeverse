## How to push this to GitHub (step-by-step)


1. Copy the entire `vibeverse/` folder to your dev machine.
2. Open terminal in the folder.
3. (Optional) Edit files and replace placeholders as needed.
4. Make the script executable: `chmod +x create_repo.sh`.
5. Run `./create_repo.sh <github-username-or-org> vibeverse` and follow the printed commands OR use the GitHub CLI:
```bash
gh repo create vibeverse --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```
6. After pushing, go to **Vercel → New Project → Import Git Repository** and select `vibeverse/web`. Set the Build Command to `npm run build` and Output Directory to `.next` (or let Vercel auto-detect Next.js).
7. Add the environment variables from `.env.example` into Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables (set values to your real Stripe & Firebase test/live keys).
8. In GitHub repo settings → Secrets, add `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` so the GitHub Actions workflow can trigger Vercel deploys.

## How to change values later (CI / env / code)


- **Environment variables (secrets):** update them in Vercel dashboard for the project. Client-safe keys must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- **CI Config (deploy.yml):** edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in the repo and push changes. The next push will run the updated workflow.
- **Change deploy target (branch):** update `on.push.branches` in the workflow YAML. For example, change from `main` to `staging`.
- **Add tests:** Add scripts to `web/package.json` and modify the `Run basic tests` step in the workflow to run `npm test`.

## Final notes & next steps I can do for you now
I can now:
- Generate a ZIP of this repo and provide a download link. (I will create it in `/mnt/data` and give you the link.)
- Create the GitHub repo for you **if** you provide a GitHub personal access token and confirm you want me to create under your account (I cannot do this without your token). Otherwise, you can run the `create_repo.sh` or use `gh repo create` locally.
- Replace placeholder TODOs in the web/mobile with working Firebase + Stripe test-mode integration (I can wire test keys and give you a demo URL if you want that next).


Which of the three would you like me to do next? (I can create the ZIP now if you'd like.)
